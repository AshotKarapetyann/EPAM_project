# Trello Application

   Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards.
   In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what,
   and where something is in a process.

   Imagine a white board, filled with lists of sticky notes,
   with each note as a task for you and your team. Now imagine that each of those sticky notes has photos,
   and a place to comment and collaborate with your teammates.

   Now imagine that you can take that whiteboard anywhere you go on your smartphone,
   and can access it from any computer through the web. That's Trello!
